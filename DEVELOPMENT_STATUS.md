## üîç Code Analysis & Next Steps

### Current Implementation Status

#### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- **Product Display**: Home grid, collection page, gallery view

### Technical Improvements Needed

#### High Priority Fixes
1. **Type Safety**: Add proper TypeScript interfaces
   ```typescript
   // Example for cart item interface
   interface CartItem {
     productId: string;
     variant: ProductVariant;
     quantity: number;
     price: number;
   }
   ```

2. **Error Handling**: Add loading states and error boundaries
3. **Performance**: Implement image lazy loading
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for stores and components

#### Code Quality Issues
- Inconsistent use of Composition API vs Options API
- Missing prop validation in components
